# credit-risk-classification

# Overview
This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the credit risk of loans. The goal is to classify loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on historical data.



# Summary
The model performs reasonably well in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans. It can be used to help assess creditworthiness, but further tuning or additional data may improve the accuracy and reliability.
